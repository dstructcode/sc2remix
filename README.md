sc2remix
========

sc2remix is primarily a project geared towards learning low level binary programming through the extraction and parsing of Starcraft II replay files. A biproduct of this task is a website that will hopefully be useful to other Starcraft II players. No requirements or design specifications have been created. As of now, the project is operating on a blank slate and has the capability of heading in any direction. Thus, though some pre-existing functionality may be repeated, newer, more innovative methods of displaying and analyzing the replay information is possible.
